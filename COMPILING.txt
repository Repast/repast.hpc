1. Create a directory (e.g. Release) in this directory.
2. Copy Makefile.tmplt into that directory and rename to Makefile.
3. Edit the copied Makefile as approriate, setting the relevant paths and so forth.
4. The make targets are repast_hpc, relogo, zombies and rumor 

Note that .gitignore ignores Release, Debug and Profiling folders by default so
anything in there will not be part of a commit and the Makefiles in there
can be freely customized.
