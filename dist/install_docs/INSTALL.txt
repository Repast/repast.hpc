Repast HPC 2.3.1 Installation

Release Date: 13 October 2021
==============================================================================


There are multiple, alternative ways to install Repast HPC. You will
find in the text below:

	1) An overview of 'What is installed' with Repast HPC
	2) A list of requirements for a Repast HPC installation
	3) An overview of the 3 methods of installing Repast HPC
	4) Step-by-step instructions for the three methods
  5) Instructions for compiling RepastHPC as static libraries when
	using the Makefile based install.

Read each section carefully to choose the method that is right for your
situation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is installed:

A complete installation of Repast HPC consists of:

	1) A collection of 'include' files, and
	2) Two 'library' files: one for RepastHPC and one for the ReLogo extensions

The 'include' files are header files (with a '.h' extenstion) that
must be 'included' in applications that wish to use Repast HPC. The library
files contain the executable functions that a RepastHPC application will use.

The RepastHPC package also includes some demonstration applications.
These are not needed to use RepastHPC, but are built as part of the
automated installation. They are intended to serve as examples for
how a RepastHPC simulation can be written, compiled, and run.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RepastHPC Dependencies and Requirements:

RepastHPC relies on a collection of tools and libraries. Note that some
of the installation procedures discussed here will install (or will give
you the option to install) some or all of these required tools and libraries,
if they are not already found on your system.

The requirements include:

	1) A C++ compiler
	2) A 'make' utility
	3) An MPI implementation
	4) The NetCDF library (C and C++ versions)
	5) The CURL library
	6) Four of the Boost libraries (serialization, system, filesystem, and mpi),
              plus header-only libraries


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Methods of installation:

There are two methods of installation provided:

	1) Unix/Linux/Mac OSX standard installation
	2) Experimental support for Windows Linux Subsystem for Windows 10

Note that Windows users must use option #2. U

Unix/Linux/MacOSX standard installation:
The most typical OS for high-performance computing systems is a Unix or
Linux-like system; the Mac OSX system is very similar. Installation on these
systems means compiling the RepastHPC libraries, and installing the libraries
and associated header files to a specific location.

For installation via this method, the existence of a C++ compiler is assumed.
The installation provided here includes means to build the other required
elements.

 Windows Linux Subsystem for Windows 10:
 The Windows Linux subsystem (WLS) provides an integrated linux install
 on Windows 10. We have had some success compiling and using Repast HPC
 in this environment. Please follow the Unix/Linux/OSX instructions
 and use the WLS environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unix/Linux/MacOSX standard installation:

General notes:
Installing and using Repast HPC requires the existence on your system
of several prerequisite components, including both tools and libraries.
The instructions and tools below show how you can determine whether these
tools and libraries exist on your system, and install them if they are not
present. One important caveat: standard installation places the tools and
libraries in common directories where they can be used by other applications;
the instructions and tools below will show you how to determine if these have
been installed in the standard places. Your system may be arranged
differently, and the libraries and tools may be in non-standard places.
Note, the automated tools below will install the required libraries etc. in
your directory. Advanced users may wish to customize the installation
to place these tools at the standard (or other) locations.

Requirement #1: A C++ Compiler
To install in a Unix/Linx/MacOSX environment you must first have a C++
compiler installed. If you do not have a C++ compiler, consult your system's
documentation or your system administrator.

(A common C++ compiler is g++; you can determine if you have gcc installed by
typing:

g++ -v

If g++ is installed and is on the execution path, this will give you version
information.)

RHPC uses some C++ features introduced with c++11. Consequently, the
C++ compiler must be C++ 11 compliant. The clang and gcc based compilers
shipping with OSX and Linux distributions are C++ 11 compliant.


Requirement #2: A 'make' utility

"make" is a utility that manages dependencies. Often compiling code depends
on compiled versions of other code; make can detect when versions change and
re-compile only the elements that need to be changed in order for the whole
collection to be current. It can also be used to automate a wide array of other
operations (copying files, etc.).

To confirm that make is installed on your system and is on the execute path,
navigate to an EMPTY directory and type:

make

If a message like 'make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.'
is the response, then make is installed.

If no 'make' is installed, you must install it; consult your system's
documentation, http://www.gnu.org/software/make/, and/or your system
administrator.


Requirement #3: The curl library

"curl" is a library that is required for Repast HPC to compile correctly. You
can install curl using a variety of methods. The install script included with
Repast HPC can also be used. To do this, navigate the MANUAL_INSTALL directory
in a command shell and type:

./install.sh curl

This will place the curl library in a ~/sfw/CURL directory where ~ is your
home directory. To change the location, edit the BASE_DIR variable at the
beginning of the install.sh script.

Requirement #4: An MPI implementation

Repast HPC requires an MPI implementation. In high-performance systems
this will be central to the system and will be managed by the system
administrator. On personal systems it may be available. Commonly the command:

mpicxx

will invoke the MPI compiler, if MPI has been fully installed. You can determine
more about your MPI installation by using the command:

which mpicxx

If you do not have an MPI implementation installed, you can choose among
several available options (e.g., openMPI, LAM/MPI, or MPICH).

If MPI is not already installed on your system and you wish to use MPICH
from the Repast HPC distribution, you can open a command prompt and:

1) Navigate to the 'MANUAL_INSTALL' directory of the Repast HPC download.
2) Use:

./install.sh mpich

This will execute the 'install' shell script and will install MPICH 3 on your
system in a ~/sfw/MPICH directory where ~ is your home directory. To change
the location, edit the BASE_DIR variable at the beginning of the install.sh
script.

A useful thing to do after this installation is to add the current mpich installation
to the execution path. The command:

  export PATH=$HOME/sfw/MPICH/bin/:$PATH

is executed. This will probably not permanently change the path variable; each time you
log out and back in to your command shell the variable will be re-set. To address this
you can add a command like:

PATH=$HOME/sfw/MPICH/bin/:$PATH

to your ~/.profile file, so that it will be executed each time you log in.


Requirement #5: NetCDF

Repast HPC requires NetCDF 4.2.1 and NetCDF C++ 4.2. If these are installed in your
system you should find the corresponding lib and include files in the standard locations.
The libraries are typically named some variation of libnetcdf.so,
libnetcdf.dylib, libnetcdf.a and libnetcdf_c++.a, libnetcdf_c++.so, and
libnetcdf_c++.dylib

If you do not have these installed, you can:

1) Navigate to the MANUAL_INSTALL directory of the Repast HPC download.
2) Use:

./install.sh netcdf

This will install both the netcdf and netcdf cpp libraries to
~/sfw/NetCDF and ~/sfw/NetCDF-cxx, respectively, where ~ is your home directory.
 Note that these are not current versions of the netcdf libraries; netcdf has
undergone an upgrade not supported by RepastHPC.

Requirement #6: Boost

Repast HPC requires the Boost library, a set of extensions to C++ available from
www.boost.org. Boost's libraries come in two varieties: some are 'header-only',
and can be used simply by including them. The others are compiled. Repast HPC
requires fourof the compiled libraries: serialization, system, filesystem, and
mpi. (The boost 'mpi'library is not to be confused with an MPI implementation
like MPICH.)

The recommended version of Boost to be used is 1.58 or later.

If you do not have a version of Boost installed, you can:

1) Navigate to the MANUAL_INSTALL directory of the Repast HPC download
2) Edit the 'install.sh' script to make the "MPI_COMPILER_INVOCATION' variable
	(line 13) to correctly invoke your MPI implementation. Generally this will be
	'mpicxx' (possibly including a full path)
3) Use:

./install.sh boost

This will install the boost libraries (version 1.61) in a ~/sfw/Boost directory
where ~ is your home directory. To change the location, edit the BASE_DIR
variable at the beginning of the install.sh script.

Note that if you are installing on OSX, the install.sh script attempts to
workaround some short comings in boost's library installation specific to
OSX. In particular, it attempts to set the install name and id of the
boost libraries correctly. If you encounter errors when running this part
of the install.sh script, comment out lines 128 - 150. Howeverm you will then
have to specify the boost library location in the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable when running repast hpc executables.

Installing Repast HPC:

You can install Repast HPC in 3 ways: 1) using the install.sh script; 2) using
the GNU autools build system; and 3) using the Makefile

1) Installing with install.sh

If you have installed everything to the default locations using the install.sh
script, you can also use the install.sh scrip to build Repast HPC. To do this,
use:

./install.sh rhpc

This will compile static and dynamic libraries for repast_hpc and the relogo
extensions and install them and the headers in ~/sfw/repast_hpc-2.3.0/lib and
~/sfw/repast_hpc-2.3.0/include respectively.

Note that the ./install.sh script uses the autotools build system, automatically
calling ./configure with the correct flags. By default the autools build
doesn't display all the compiler output. To see the entirety of the output
(e.g. to help in debugging a failed compile), see the instructions on line
134 of install.sh

You can also force the install.sh script to use the Makefile, rather running
the autotools build. See line 138 of install.sh for instructions.

2) Installing with the autotools build system.

To install with RepastHPC using autools, run the following 3 commands in a
terminal shell.

./configure [options]
make
make install

The relevant options to configure are:

--prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                        (e.g. $HOME/sfw/repast_hpc-2.3.0)
--with-necdf            root netcdf directory that contains include and lib
--with-netcdf-include   directory containing netcdf headers (netcdf.h).
--with-netcdf-lib-dir   directory containing netcdf libraries.
--with-necdf-cxx        root netcdf-cxx directory that contains include and
                        lib
--with-netcdf-cxx-include
                        directory containing netcdf-cxx headers
                        (netcdfcpp.h).
--with-netcdf-cxx-lib-dir
                        directory containing netcdf-cxx libraries.
--with-curl-include     directory containing curl headers (curl.h).
--with-curl-lib-dir     directory containing curl libraries.
--with-boost-include    directory containing boost headers (boost/*.hpp).
--with-boost-lib-dir    directory containing boost libraries.
--with-boost-lib-suffix suffix in boost library names (e.g -mt in
                        libboost_serialization-mt).

You can use these options to specify the locations of netcdf, netcdf-cxx, boost
and curl. Note that if you use the --with-netcdf and --with-netcdf-cxx options
then the -include and -lib-dir variations are not necessary. However, in that
case lib and include directories must exist under the specified netcdf and
netcdf-cxx directories.

A ./configure example, using the install.sh defaults:

./configure --prefix=/home/nick/sfw/repast_hpc-2.3.0
	--with-boost-include=/home/nick/sfw/Boost/Boost_1.61/include
	--with-boost-lib-dir=/home/nick/sfw/Boost/Boost_1.61/lib
	--with-boost-lib-suffix=-mt
	--with-netcdf-cxx=/home/nick/sfw/NetCDF-cxx
	--with-netcdf=/home/nick/sfw/NetCDF
	--with-curl-include=/home/nick/sfw/CURL/include
	--with-curl-lib-dir=/home/nick/sfw/CURL/lib

Additional options are described in the configure help: ./configure -h

3) Installing with the Makefile

To install Repast HPC without using the install script or the autotools build,
you must manually edit the 'Makefile' under the MANUAL_INSTALL directory. The
first lines of this file should specifiy the locations of the required libraries
described above. You should modify these lines so that the values used are
correct. What is provided below is an example only.


# VARIABLES (Supply values for these; for definitions and examples, see INSTALL)
CXX=/usr/local/bin/mpicxx
CXXLD=/usr/local/bin/mpicxx
BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/nick/sfw/Boost/Boost_1.61/include
BOOST_LIB_DIR=/home/nick/sfw/Boost/Boost_1.61/lib
BOOST_INFIX=-mt
NETCDF_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/
NETCDF_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib/
CURL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/
CURL_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib/

INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/sfw/repast_hpc-2.3.0


Note that the 'BOOST_INFIX' value should represent any characters that boost's
installation has placed in the names of the files it created, between the
library name and the extension. For example, if the boost serialization
library is named libboost_serialization-mt.so, then the value for the 'infix'
 would be '-mt'.

For all 'include' and 'lib' directories, simply specify the appropriate path.

Make sure that the CXX and CXXLD variables are correctly set. These should
point to your mpi compiler (generally both will be 'mpicxx', but the full
path to the MPI wrapper compiler can be used if needed).

When this is done, navigate in a shell to the Repast HPC 'MANUAL_INSTALL'
directory and type

make -f Makefile all

This will build the libraries for Repast HPC and Relogo, and place these in a
lib directory within the directory specified by the INSTALL_DIR variable. This
will also copy the relevant include files to an include directory. It will
then build the 'Zombies' and 'Rumor Model' demos, and place these in bin/zombie
and bin/rumor repsectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can run the Zombies and Rumor models demos by cd'ing to the relevant
location (e.g. INSTALL_DIR/bin/zombie), and

Zombies:
	mpirun -n 4 ./zombie_model config.props model.props

Rumor:
	mpirun -n 4 ./rumor_model config.props model.props

Note that the libraries and the executables are compiled with RPATH and
install names flags on Linux and OSX respectively. These flags define where
the library or executable expects to find its dependencies. If you move the
libraries from their installed locations, then the library or executable that
depends on the moved library will no longer work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling as static libraries

The autotools build whether called directly or via install.sh will build both
static and dynamic libraries. However, the installation using the Makefile
whether run directly or called from install.sh will compile the repast hpc
libraries as dynamic shared libraries. If you need compile them as static
libraries, for example, if your cluster or HPC setup expects static libraries,
you will need to do the following:

1) Use the MPI that is installed on your cluster / HPC machine, and NOT
the one bundled with this distribution and mentioned above.

2) Set the STATIC variable in the Makefile (line 18) to true:
	STATIC = true
3) make all

Depending on your system configuration, the executables may fail to compile,
but the static libraries should compile correctly. Check the output.
