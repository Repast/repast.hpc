\subsection{Detailed Description}
Importer that maintains a simple count of the agents being sent from each sending process. 

When the count for a given process is zero no mpi 'receive' is created for that process; when the count is nonzero, a 'receive' is created. Note that no record of which agents are requested is kept, only the count of agents requested is kept.

Given an agent request (including requests for agents on multiple other processes), makes a record of the agents that are being requested by this process and will therefore be received from other processes. 

The record must at a minimum indicate which other processes are sending agent information, but may include other information, such as how many times a particular agent has been requested.
