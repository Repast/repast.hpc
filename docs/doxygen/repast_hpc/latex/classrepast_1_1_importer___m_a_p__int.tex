\subsection{Detailed Description}
Importer that maintains a map of agents being sent from each sending process and a count of the number of times that agent was requested. 

This is semantically equivalent to a 'L\-I\-S\-T' type, but may be more or less appropriate in specific contexts based on performance. Duplicate requests for an agent increment the count associated with that agent; canceling a request reduces that count. If a given sending process has no agents being shared, no mpi 'receive' will be created, but if there are agents being shared, a 'receive' will be created.

Given an agent request (including requests for agents on multiple other processes), makes a record of the agents that are being requested by this process and will therefore be received from other processes. 

The record must at a minimum indicate which other processes are sending agent information, but may include other information, such as how many times a particular agent has been requested.
